# Problem Set 1

## Instructions:
To do the assignment:
- [ ] Click on '<> Code' button at the top of this page and at the bottom of the menu "Download ZIP" to get the files.
- [ ] Double click on `instructions.html` to open the instructions in the browser.
- [ ] Complete Problem 1 and Problem 2 in the specified `.py` files, `Karel_Newspaper.py` and `Karel_Painting.py`.
- [ ] Once you have everything working locally on your system, go ahead and upload your completed versions of `Karel_Newspaper.py` and `Karel_Painting.py` back here to GitHub. Please don't change the names. You will overwrite the originals, and that is totally ok and desired.

If you have issues or come across problems or parts of the instructions that are unclear, please don't hesitate to ask on Discord or via email or in person!

_Don't wait until the last minute to try to make it through everything! Computers (and code) have a way of sensing your desperation and choosing that exact moment to have the most random things go wrong!_
